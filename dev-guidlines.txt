Developer Guidelines

Welcome! Please follow these guidelines when contributing to this project.

1. Branching Strategy

Always create your branch from the main branch.

Follow this branch naming convention:

feature/<your-feature-name>


Example:

feature/abc




2. Directory Structure for Features

Before starting work on your feature, create a directory under the project root with the same name as your feature branch.

Inside this directory, include a styles folder. Do not create styles inside component files.

Example:

project-root/
│
└── feature/abc/
    ├── styles/
    └── [your feature files]


For images used in your feature, create a folder under assets/images/ with the same name as your feature.

Example:

assets/images/feature-abc/


Always refer to the existing project structure before starting your work to ensure consistency.



3. Workflow Summary

Pull the latest changes from main.

Create a new branch following the branch naming convention.

Create a directory matching your branch name.

Implement your feature inside that directory.

Commit and push your changes.

Create a Pull Request for review.
