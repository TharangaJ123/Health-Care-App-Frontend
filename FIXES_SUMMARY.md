# Health Care App - Medication CRUD Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Missing `AsyncStorage` import in `EditMedicationScreen.js`
- **Fix**: Added `import AsyncStorage from '@react-native-async-storage/async-storage';`

### 2. Navigation Issues ✅
- **Problem**: Using `navigation.pop()` instead of `navigation.goBack()`
- **Fix**: Replaced all instances of `navigation.pop()` with `navigation.goBack()` in:
  - `EditMedicationScreen.js` (6 instances)
  - All navigation calls now use the correct method

### 3. Data Structure Mismatches ✅
- **Problem**: Notification service expected `reminderTimes` and `daysOfWeek` but medication data used `times`
- **Fix**: Updated `NotificationService.js` to:
  - Use `medication.times` as primary source
  - Fallback to `medication.reminderTimes` for backward compatibility
  - Handle both 12-hour and 24-hour time formats
  - Default to all days of week if not specified

### 4. Medication CRUD Operations ✅
- **Problem**: ID type inconsistencies causing edit/delete failures
- **Fix**: 
  - Added proper ID conversion in `loadMedication()`
  - Fixed ID handling in `handleUpdate()` and `handleDelete()`
  - Ensured consistent numeric ID usage throughout
  - Added comprehensive error handling and logging

### 5. HomeScreen Data Access ✅
- **Problem**: Incorrect property access for medication data
- **Fix**: Updated `renderMedicationItem` to use `item.medicationId` for navigation

### 6. Notification Scheduling ✅
- **Problem**: Missing `daysOfWeek` property for notification scheduling
- **Fix**: Added `daysOfWeek: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` to medication data before scheduling notifications
